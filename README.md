These are all examples of data visualizations that I created using Python's "Pandas" data analysis library.  In particuar, you will notice that the quality of the images is pristine due to the fact that scalable vector graphics were used. 

Finally, data was mined, and then extracted, into the following delimited format in order to be visualized.  Here
is an example of the output of mined data that I used to create my visualizations:
